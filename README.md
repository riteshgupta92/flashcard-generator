# Flashcard Generator

## Overview

The Flashcard Generator is a React-based application designed for users to create, manage, and study flashcards. The project emphasizes simplicity in managing flashcards, with a focus on a clean user interface using Tailwind CSS. It incorporates state management and routing to provide a smooth user experience for navigating and interacting with flashcards.
